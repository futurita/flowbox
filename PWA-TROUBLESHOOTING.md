# 🔧 PWA Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: PWA Not Working

The main issue is that **the icon files are missing**. Here's how to fix it:

## ✅ Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Create Icons (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Open the icon generator
open create-simple-icons.html
```

**Then:**
1. Click each "Download" button
2. Save ALL files to the `icons/` folder
3. Make sure filenames are exactly: `icon-72x72.png`, `icon-96x96.png`, etc.

### 2. Verify Files
```bash
# Check if icons exist
ls -la icons/
```

You should see 8 PNG files.

### 3. Test PWA
```bash
# Start with HTTPS (required for PWA)
npm run pwa
```

### 4. Open in Chrome/Edge
- Go to `https://localhost:3000`
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Check Console for errors
- Look for "SW registered" message
